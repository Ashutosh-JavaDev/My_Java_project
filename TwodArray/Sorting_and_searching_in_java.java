/*Project Title: Sorting Algorithms and Linear Search in Java

Project Description:
The Sorting Algorithms and Linear Search project aims to implement various sorting algorithms (bubble sort, insertion sort) and the linear search algorithm in Java. Instead of a graphical interface, the project will be implemented through the command line interface (CLI).

Key Features of the Project:

Sorting Algorithms: Implement bubble sort and insertion sort algorithms in Java to sort integer arrays in ascending or descending order.

Linear Search: Implement the linear search algorithm to find the position of a given integer in an array.

User Interaction: Use the command line interface to allow users to input an array of integers and choose the sorting algorithm they want to apply or perform a linear search.

Step-by-step Display (Optional): Optionally, you can implement a step-by-step display of sorting algorithms' progress and linear search steps in the CLI to visualize how the algorithms work.

Input Validation: Ensure that the user's input is validated to handle incorrect inputs gracefully.*/

    <h1>My Education</h1>
    <br>
    <big>By the way, I was born in Jharkhand but my entire studies have been done from<b><u> Bhagalpur, Bihar</u></b>.I started my Education Journey from <u>St.Teresa School.</u>
   <br>From my Childhood i have not intrest at study,i also failed once in my school at very minor class cause i always wanted to be a <b>Singer</b> and for that i also ready to join any Singing classes,but unfortunately,i get agreed with my parents for Study,and got ready to quit my Dream.Actually I was the one of the most Average Student of my Family or you can say below Average.And as time was passing by, my interest in studies was get decreasing,and the passion of Singing and listening Music got increased,And put that towards the song started appearing on my result,my marks at <u>Class 6 </u> was actually very poor,due to this i had to drop my name from that school and got Admission at <u><b>Divine Happy School,</b></u> whose just name is only happy,real downfall was got started from this school at <u><b>Class 7.Since i am an introvert guy of my class, then also i make some good friends,not they help to find my crush nor they help me to get first in the class,but after that also they are very good enough.

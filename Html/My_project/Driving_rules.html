                <li>When the vehicle ahead of you passes that object, start counting "one-thousand-one, one-thousand-two, one-thousand-three.</li>
                <li>If you reach the object before you finish counting to "one-thousand-three," it means you are following too closely and should increase your following distance.</li>
